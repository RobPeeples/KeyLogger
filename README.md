# KeyLogger with Reverse Shell
  This is the source code for a collaborative project between Rob Peeples, Ricky Rodriguez, Jose Santiago, and Brian Mancil. 
This repository contains instructions on implementation of the code, the code itself, along with programs written to help filter through the data 
and recover important information such as emails or credit card numbers.

  Once the program is running on the target/victim's computer, every keystroke they input into their machine will be recorded into a log file. To improve readability 
and help with data filtering, each inputted word is on a separate line with the time it was typed to the left of it. The log file is created as soon as the program 
runs and can be accessed at a later time through a reverse shell that is created once a minute. Alternatively, you can have the log file sent to your email once a
day (or however frequent you want). 

  This project is for ETHICAL purposes ONLY and should NOT be used on an unknowing person/persons. We do not advocate malicious hacking, 
  and we are not responsible for the misuse of this product.
